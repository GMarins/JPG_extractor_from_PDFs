# JPG_extractor_from_PDFs
Python function that extracts the JPG images from a PDF file to a folder. 

The structure of PDF files is quite complex. As images are stored in PDFs 'as-is', the code basically writes to a JPG file the stream of  characters between the beginning and end tags of a typical JPG in the PDF file. 

Read the .py file for more info. 

Credits to  Ned Batchelder for coming out with the initial idea.
